# Organizing Web App

## Current Status

By now, I have just coded some static HTML and CSS (Bootstrap) to get an overview on what to do. I also added some static Javascript-Objects to render the page based on them. I will start to write the backend as soon as I finished the frontend to a point on which I can say which models will be needed.

## Requirements

To run the development version of this project, you used to have Node.js to be installed on your machine. 

Get Node.js from here:

On Windows, installing it with the .msi installer is the most easiest way.
